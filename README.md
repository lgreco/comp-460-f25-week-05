# Week 04: The Fast Fourier Transform

The assignment can be found in the Jupyter notebook named [assignment.ipynb](./assignment.ipynb).

Please do not modify the contents in folder `.devcontainer` and in file `requirements.txt`.

## How to work on this assigment

There are three ways to prepare and submit this assigment: in GitHub Codespaces, in Google Colab, or in your own environment.

### Github

**Requires some familiarity with Github and Codespaces.** You will need a GitHub account for this. If you already have one, make sure that you official LUC email address is listed as one of your email addresses. If you do not have one, create one using your LUC email address (you can add other email addresses as well).

Simply fork this repository. Keep your fork public. In your fork, click on the green "code" button, and select "create codespace on main". This will launch a web-based instance of Visual Studio Code with everything you need to work on the assigment. Codespaces take a few minutes to setup the first time you create them, no don't worry if nothing happens for 3-6 minutes.

In this case it's important to remember that no one can see your Codespace but you. When you are ready to submit the assignment, you must commit and synchronize your Codespace with Github. In Sakai, paste the link to your repository in Github. (An easy-to-make mistake here is to copy and paste in Sakai the link to your Codespace. Such links end in `.dev`).

### Google Colab

Colab is a Jupyter notebook environment from Google. If you have a Google email address, you have access to Colab. Direct your browser to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). In the File menu, click Open notebook, click on Github, paste the following URL in the text box:
```text
https://github.com/lgreco/comp-460-f25-week-04
```
and then press Tab or click on the search button (it looks like a magnifying glass). You'll see the notebook `assignment.ipynb` appearing in the list. Click on the `open assignment.ipynb in new tab` button -- it looks like a square with an arrow pointing out.

When it's time to submit your assignment, go to your Colab's share option, **make your notebook public,** copy its link, and paste the link to Sakai.

### Your own environment

The previous two options are useful if you wish to carry out your work in a Jupyter notebook. If you present to use plain Python, or any other programming language, you are welcome to use any environment you are familiar with. In this case you may have to copy and paste some code, if you are working with Python, or write everything from scratch if you are working in another language.

When you are ready to submit your work, upload the file with your code in Sakai.

## What not to upload

Under any circumstances, do not upload a Jupyter notebook to Sakai. That's a file with the extension `.ipynb` to Sakai. It will disqualify your submission. Changing the file extension will not help.

If you work with Jupyter notebooks, please submit only a link to a Github repository or to a public Colab notebook.

A link ending in `.dev` is *not* a repository link.

The only files you may upload are standard source code files: `.py` for Python, `.java` for Java, `.c` for C, `.rs` for Rust, etc.

If you are not certain, please ask.
